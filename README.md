# Ecommerce-Sales-Using-PowerBI

This project is a Sales Analytics Dashboard made with Power BI Desktop to examine the performance of an e-commerce business called Madhav Ecommerce. The main goal of this dashboard is to understand overall sales, profit trends, customer buying patterns, and performance by category through interactive visuals.

In this dashboard, I looked at key business metrics like Total Sales Amount (438K), Total Profit (37K), Total Quantity Sold (5615), and Average Orders. The analysis is divided by month, quarter, state, city, product category, sub-category, and payment mode. The dashboard shows that Clothing has the highest quantity sold, while sub-categories like Printers and Bookcases generate more profit. The profit distribution by month and quarter helps identify seasonal trends in sales.

I also examined sales by state and city to gain insights into regional performance. The payment mode analysis reveals customer preferences for COD, UPI, cards, and EMI. Filters for state and quarter make the dashboard interactive and easy to navigate.

Through this project, I learned how to clean and prepare sales data using Power Query, create DAX measures for KPIs, and design visually balanced dashboards. This project taught me how Power BI can be used in real-world e-commerce settings for tracking sales performance, improving product strategy, and supporting business decisions. The skills I gained are directly useful for data analyst and business intelligence roles.
